# Diversity-Inclusion-Dashboard
### Overview 
This Power BI Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard provides insights into employee hiring, promotion, turnover, performance and age group broken down by gender, job level, and various other filters such as nationality, department, and age group. It is designed to help an organization track its diversity and inclusion performance.

### Key Elements of the Dashboard:
- The top portion of the dashboard contains navigation tabs that allow users to filter data by different aspects such as Hiring, Promotion, Turnover, Performance, and Age Group.
- The filters include Nationality, Department, Age Group, and Job Level Group, allowing for further drill-down analysis.
### Key Performance Indicator (KPI)
- Total Employee Count: There are 500 employees in the company, with 66 employees hired Month-To-Date (MTD).
- Total Leavers: Displays 47 employees who have left the organization. A breakdown of 9.4% of employees leaving and 90.6% employees still present.
- Total Rand: Represents a budget or cost value of 0.25K.
- Turnover Rate: A 10.1% turnover rate that indicates the percentage of employees leaving the organization within a given period.

- The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of gender diversity in hiring across different job levels. While higher-level positions such as Executive and Director are predominantly filled by men, there is a clear improvement in gender diversity at lower job levels, such as Junior Officers.
The filters at the top allow users to explore data by various demographics like department or age group, which can give further insight into hiring trends and workforce diversity.
The overall male-to-female hiring ratio indicates that 59% of hires are men, whereas 41% are women, but there is positive progress in gender equality in certain job categories. This dashboard allows decision-makers to evaluate diversity policies and see where further efforts might be needed.
